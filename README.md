# JavaScript Design Patterns
Design patterns in JavaScript are reusable solutions to commonly occurring programming problems. They are best practices that provide a structured approach to writing code that is more readable, maintainable, and efficient. Design patterns can help you write better code, avoid common mistakes, and improve the quality of your JavaScript applications. This repo showcases some of the common design patterns while broadly diving those into three.

## Design pattern classification
In Javascript, the design patterns can be classified into four broad categories which are as follows:
	- Structural Design Patterns
		Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. These patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures, and how the interfaces between these structures can be simplified and optimized.
	- Behavioural Design Patterns
		Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on communication and interaction between objects, and the distribution of responsibilities among objects. These patterns are concerned with how objects communicate with each other and how they work together to achieve common goals.
	- Creational Design Patterns
		Creational design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns are concerned with the process of object creation and the ways in which objects can be instantiated and composed into larger structures.
	- Other useful patterns
		Other common patterns prevalent in programming that don't below the above three.
### 1. Structural Design Patterns
	- Proxy pattern
		The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. The Proxy pattern involves creating a new object that has the same interface as an existing object, and which forwards requests to the original object or performs additional logic before or after forwarding the request.
	- Adapter pattern
		The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. This pattern is used when we want to use an existing class that has an interface that is not compatible with the interface we need.
	- Bridge pattern
		The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. This pattern involves creating two separate abstraction and implementation hierarchies, which can then be composed independently.
	- Composite Pattern
		The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat a group of objects in the same way as a single object. This pattern is used when we want to represent a hierarchical structure of objects as a tree-like structure, where the individual objects and groups of objects are treated in the same way.
	- Decorator Pattern
		The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern involves wrapping an object within another object, thereby adding new behaviors or responsibilities to it.In other words, the Decorator pattern involves adding functionality to an object at runtime by wrapping it in another object that has the same interface.
	- Facade Pattern
		The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, objects, or APIs. The Facade pattern involves creating a single class or object that exposes a simple interface that is easy to use, hiding the underlying complexity of the system.
	- Flyweight Pattern
		The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that is used to minimize memory usage and improve performance by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. The Flyweight pattern involves creating a pool of reusable objects that can be shared among multiple clients, instead of creating a new object every time one is needed.
### 2. Behavioural Design Patterns
	- Strategy pattern
	- Iterator pattern
	- Mediator pattern
	- Observer pattern
	- Visitor pattern
### 3. Creational Design Patterns
	- Factory Pattern
	- Singleton Pattern
	- 
### 4. Other Patterns
	- Retry Pattern
